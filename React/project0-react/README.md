# ToDo Application - React Addition

This project is implementing the ToDo app from CS50 but in React. 

This project is discussed and done by the course instructor so a lot of the code is similar. I however, wrote it in a React app (as opposed to a JS file), and added some styling as an opportunity to learn more about react-bootstrap.
